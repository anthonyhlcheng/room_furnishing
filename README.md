The Room Furnishing Problem 

### Requirements for algorithm
- Shapely (https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project.html#requirements)
- Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)

### To run algorithm on Linux
`./run.sh [Version Number] [Comment]`

*Output will then be stored in the file __ouputs/output\_[Version Number].txt__*

*Comment will automatically append to the bottom of this README*
